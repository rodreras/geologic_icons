# USGS Geologic Symbols

This repository contains several geologic svg symbols created by [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov). You
can find symbologies for structural geology, paleontology, geophysics, hydrogeology, hazard studies and
many more.
These symbols were created by [FGDC Digital Cartographic Standard for Geologic Map Symbolization](https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/fgdc_gds/geolsymstd.php)
and can help several geoscientist around the world.

*The symbols were downloaded by me in 2020, and I couldn't find the exactly link.*
